== Description ==

Menage and create ads.txt for adv integration

Ads.txt is an IAB standard to improve the advertising transparency of sellers. publishers through this file are able to certify who is authorized to sell advertising on their website.


The use of ads.txt is not mandatory, but strongly recommended. The ads.tx files can help you protect your brand from counterfeited inventory that intentionally has incorrect labels indicating where it came from a specific domain, app, or video. Declaring authorized sellers can help you get a larger share of advertising spending that would otherwise be directed to a counterfeit inventory.
